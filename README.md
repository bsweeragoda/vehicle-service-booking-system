🔐 Authentication Flow

User registers as Customer

Password is hashed using bcrypt

JWT token is generated upon login

Protected routes are accessed using JWT middleware

Role-based authorization ensures Admin & Customer access control

🗃 Database Schema (Example)
User Model

name

email

password

role (admin / customer)

Booking Model

user (ObjectId)

vehicleType

serviceType

bookingDate

status (Pending / Approved / Completed)
